# Disclaimer
I do not know whether the LGT chip infringes on Microchip/Atmel patents; if it does, I most certainly do not condone it. Anyway, I have yet to do any modification to this code, so I suggest going to to upstream repository, as it may have been updated since I forked this.

# LarduinoISP
